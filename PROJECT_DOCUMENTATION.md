## 1. Introduction - Idea and Purpose

### Project Overview
The Flora Danica Duvet Finder is an interactive web application designed to help users discover the perfect duvet from the Flora Danica collection. The tool addresses the common challenge of duvet selection by guiding users through a personalized recommendation process based on their sleep preferences, lifestyle, and specific needs.

### Business Context
Developed for Dykon A/S, a Danish company specializing in high-quality duvets and pillows, this digital solution enhances the company's online presence while positioning them as experts in sleep comfort. The tool serves both B2B and B2C markets by providing an engaging, educational experience that simplifies the complex decision-making process of duvet selection.

### User Problem
Choosing the right duvet involves numerous factors including warmth preferences, seasonal use, allergy considerations, budget constraints, and sustainability values. Traditional product listings provide information but lack guidance on how these factors interact to determine the best choice for individual users.

### Solution Approach
Our solution provides a guided, interactive experience that:
- Collects user preferences through an intuitive question flow
- Applies algorithmic matching to recommend suitable products
- Explains recommendations with clear, reasoned justifications
- Enables detailed product comparisons
- Maintains accessibility and usability standards throughout

## 3. Data Model and State Flow

### Data Architecture

**Duvet Interface**
```typescript
interface Duvet {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  brand: string;
  price: number;
  warmthLevel: 'cool' | 'medium' | 'warm' | 'extra-warm';
  fillingType: 'down' | 'synthetic' | 'down-alternative' | 'wool' | 'bamboo';
  season: 'summer' | 'spring-autumn' | 'winter' | 'all-season';
  allergyFriendly: 'yes' | 'no' | 'hypoallergenic';
  sustainability: { sustainable: boolean; certifications: string[] };
  // Additional properties for comprehensive product data
}
```

**User Preferences Flow**
1. **Collection:** Questions capture sleep temperature, season needs, allergies, budget, sustainability preferences
2. **Processing:** Preferences converted to scoring criteria for recommendation algorithm
3. **Matching:** Each duvet evaluated against user criteria with weighted scoring
4. **Ranking:** Products sorted by match percentage with detailed explanations

### State Management Strategy

**Application State Levels:**
- **Component State:** Local UI interactions (form inputs, selection states)
- **Application State:** User preferences, recommendations, comparison selections
- **Derived State:** Calculated recommendations, comparison differences, UI state

**Data Flow Pattern:**
```
User Input → Preference Collection → Algorithm Processing → 
Recommendation Generation → Results Display → Comparison (Optional)
```

**State Persistence:**
- Session-based storage for user preferences
- No permanent data storage (privacy-conscious design)
- State reset capability for new sessions

### Algorithm Logic

**Recommendation Scoring (100-point scale):**
- Sleep Temperature Matching: 25 points
- Season Compatibility: 20 points  
- Allergy Considerations: 20 points
- Budget Alignment: 15 points
- Sustainability Match: 10 points
- Base Quality Score: 10 points

**Comparison Processing:**
- Automated property difference detection
- Visual highlighting of significant variations
- Summary generation of key differences
- Feature-by-feature analysis
